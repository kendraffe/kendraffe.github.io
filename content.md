## Kazoo

_People management platform with HR resource library. Tone: Expert and engaging (entertainer archetype). Goal: Help companies create rewarding and purpose-driven workplaces while dominating search for our target keywords.

_**Note:** Kazoo is now WorkTango.

[20 Examples of Constructive Feedback for Performance Reviews]({{page.feedback_link}})

I'm especially proud of this one, which gives the reader tools for providing effective, constructive employee feedback even in difficult situations and consistently ranked #1 for the kw "constructive feedback examples" while I was at Kazoo, averaging 30k pageviews a month.

(Please forgive the new and somewhat dreadful title, which is after my time.)

[How to Welcome a New Employee to the Team Remotely]({{page.firstday_link}})

This guide to help HR pros set up employees for success was one of many that needed a big overhaul when the tech world went remote in 2020. I still love this one for its empathetic take, actionable tips, and emphasis on humanizing the workplace.

##**Sales Hacker**
_Thought leadership for B2B sales. Goal: Build Sales Hacker's brand as the premier destination for salespeople to learn, grow, and level up in their careers.

[Why You (Probably) Shouldn't Worry About a Recession]({{page.recession_link}})

I hosted a webinar with 4 leaders who led sales teams through the 2008 recession. Here's what they said. 

This was an exercise in working with executives, seeking out and uplifting diverse voices, and providing actionable takeaways at a time of great uncertainty.

[What Blew My Mind at the Sales Success Summit]({{page.summit_link}})

A little field work in the community.

[We Asked 10 Sales Leaders About the Economy]({{page.economy_link}})

More work with diverse leaders, influencers and executives to reinforce Sales Hacker's brand reputation as a leader in the sales thought space.

## Pedernales Electric Cooperative

_80-year-old rural electric utility with 300k customers. Tone: Classic corporate (hero archetype). Goal: Promote reliability; boost customer satisfaction._

[Reliability 365: Voltage regulator maintenance]({{page.voltage_link}})

This was an incredibly fun challenge. Because PEC operates in a noncompetitive territory, we were never competing for customers -- instead, we aimed to boost existing customer satisfaction by promoting our bang-for-buck value, reliability, and community service programs. This story's aim was to help customers understand all the work that was going on behind the scenes to keep the lights on, and required me to (learn, and then) translate complex mechanical procedures into an accessible, engaging read.

[Are unattended space heaters running up your bill?]({{page.heater_link}})

Two of our core messaging pillars were electrical safety and electrical savings. This piece marries both, and brings it home with a human interest anecdote.

[Oh, the places you can go on a single charge]({{page.charge_link}})

When our team was brainstorming ways to promote the cooperative's new electric vehicle charging stations, I pitched this piece -- a travel feature exploring fascinating sites a driver could see if they charged their vehicle at our headquarters and headed out into the country. Our staff photographer came along, and we captured some truly beautiful gems.

[Celebrating the power of PEC's working moms]({{page.mom_link}})

In addition to promoting our reliability, value, and safety, our communications team helped put a human face on our large corporate utility by featuring employee stories. I did this longform piece for Mother's Day in 2017; this is the only set of interviews I ever did for the company that made me cry. These women are incredible, and I'm honored to highlight their work.

[Beat the heat with our summer usage tips]({{page.peak_link}})

[Look for capital credits on your December bill]({{page.credits_link}})

It was frequently necessary for our team to communicate deeply complex information to our public, like our summer peak use and capital credits programs. The former was new, aiming to encourage customers to save by educating them about the tricky calculus by which the state sets power prices for utilities based on summer use; the latter was a decades-old legacy program with language inherited from (and highly regulated by) our legal department. My emphasis for these pieces was to communicate the relevant aspects of these programs as clearly and correctly as possible.

## Cratejoy

_Subscription-based e-commerce start-up. Tone: Chatty, casual; lifestyle magazine. Goal: Drive marketplace sales and top search rankings._

[5 Hobbies to Revitalize Your Self-Care Routine]({{page.selfcare_link}})

In its marketing, Cratejoy takes care to thoughtfully connect its customers' needs with the set-it-and-forget-it power of subscription businesses -- and self-care is a topic we take seriously. This longer lifestyle piece with promotional content was crafted with an academic reader in mind.

[Summer Solstice Rituals to Celebrate the Longest Day of the Year]({{page.solstice_link}})

One thing I deeply love about working with Cratejoy is getting to learn new things while generating content. In this promotional piece, I researched ancient traditions, then looped them into a contemporary retail listicle.

[5 Female Entrepreneurs on How To Build Self-Esteem in Girls]({{page.female_link}})

This piece does a little B2B and B2C double duty, featuring interviews with merchants on the platform and finishing it off with a splash of feel-good girl power.

[Make Flying a Breeze: Tips for Traveling with Toddlers]({{page.toddler_link}}) 

[We Love Snail Mail! How to Prepare for Your Next Delivery]({{page.snail_link}})

These pieces provide actionable, relevant tips with promoted content.

## Blog: The Amazing Skybrary

_In 2015, I was wrapping up my library science master's degree and teaching English at Skybridge Academy, an Austin, TX private school serving grades 6-12. Over the course of a summer and with a budget of $500, I developed a 1,000-volume collection, catalog, and functioning school library program, and kept a blog to help others do the same._

[The Amazing Skybrary Blog]({{page.skybrary_link}})

Main page and archives.

[Awash in a sea of books? You need a collection development policy!]({{page.colldev_link}})

Ready to get technical (services)? This post gets into the nitty gritty of collection development principles to transform a room of books into a library, including resources, how to develop a selection philosophy, weeding, and more.

[Sex in the library (books!) How our students helped me develop a plan to handle mature content in their Skybrary]({{page.mature_link}})

Partway through the project, I ran into a challenge -- in a library with a wide audience, what do you do with content that's developmentally risky for some, and necessary for others? My students had an idea.

## The Writing World

_Writing -- both craft and business -- is hard. Sometimes I learn stuff, and put it on my website so it can help others, too._

[You've just finished NaNoWriMo. Now what?]({{page.nano_link}})

Every November, the writing world enters the National Novel-Writing Month frenzy in a madcap challenge to write 50,000 words in 30 days. But what happens when you finish? Read on.

[The surprising liberation of deeply bad reviews]({{page.badreviews_link}})

It's common knowledge in the industry that you shouldn't read reviews of your work. I did it anyway, and what I learned surprised me.

[Confessions of an MFA screener]({{page.mfa_link}})

Check your headers, don't submit farce, and don't optimize for page count -- and other heartfelt tips gleaned from years of screening MFA applications in fiction.
